A satellite is a small solid body that circulates around             bigger celestial objects such as planets.                  Some of these satellites are small             but some of them are big.              There are around 200 known satellites in our Solar System.","Mercury \& Venus                    Don’t forget! Some of the planets don’t have a satellite             at all. Meet Mercury and Venus! They don’t have any             satellites. Mercury and Venus are within the orbit of Sun.             This means, they are always located near it. They are so             close to. The Sun that any satellite of these two planets             can’t resist its gravitational attraction.","Earth                                                                              A theory tells that Moon, which                                                                    is the only natural satellite of                                                                         Earth, formed after a giant                                                                             impact between Earth                                                                                and a solid body as big                                                                                  as Mars.

It                      Mars             has two satellites. The potato             shaped satellites are Phobos             and Deimos.                               Potatoes are                                       very significant nutritions for people. They                                          are rich and high in starch which contains                                          carbonhydrate.  Carbonhydrates are nutrients                                           used as an energy source. With only half of the                                          calories used in our body, they turn into energy                                       very quickly.             Phobos is getting closer to Mars everyday. In about             50 million years, Phobos can crash into a planet, get destroyed             by Mars’s gravititional field or become a thin ring around Mars                                     itself. The relative size of Phobos is only 1/1000                                           of the Earth. So if  someone is 68                                             kilograms on Earth, they can                                              weigh only up to 68 grams                                             on Phobos.

The largest satellites are             called Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Io             which is covered with sulfur, has over 400 active             volcanoes.              Europa’s surface is more likely covered with ice. Therefore, it             is highly thought that it’s a location for potential habitability            since Europa has two times more water than Earth.              Ganymede is the largest object in our Solar System which             is bigger than the planet, Mercury. It is also the only moon             known to create a magnetic field.              The ancient surface of Callisto is very much old and heavily             cratered. These are the evidence of what happened in the             early stages of Solar System.","Saturn is famous for its ring system. The ringlets are made of chunks of ice and rock              which are parts of shattered satellites. Including 29 temporary satellites, Saturn has                                                                                                                  62 in total.                        Titan is the most important moonlet of Saturn. It is Saturn’s largest but Solar                  System’s second largest natural moonlet. It is also known as the only body other             than Earth, where liquid has been found on its surface. The heat of Titan’s surface is            so low that it is covered with ice instead of rock. The atmosphere allows just enough                                                        liquid to the formation of liquid methane and ethane.                Scientists and observers are claiming that Titan clouds also have more to discover,               such as raining methane and ethane on the surface, making lakes exist a couple of                             kilometers wide and hundreds of meters deep, similar to water on Earth.              Enceladus, which is another moonlet of Saturn, has a subsurface water ocean in the                                                                                                     south polar surface.                                                                                        Is Life Possible on Moonlets?                    Many researches, observations and water examples found on Europa, Titan and                     Enceladus, made scientists very excited about all the adventure, the potentially                                                                       habitable environment in these moonlets.                                                    Despite Jupiter and Saturn being far away from the Sun                                                    for not known to support life, the observers still drawed                                                   their attention to knowledge because of the presence of                                                         Saturn                                                                                               subsurface water ocean.","Uranus is the 7th planet of the Solar System which has             27 known satellites. Instead of Greek Mythology, these             satellites were named after William Shakespeare’s Summer             Night Dream fairies Oberon and Titania, Alexander              Pope’s mythological creatures Ariel and Umbriel.              In all the satellites of Uranus, Ariel probably has the most             glowing and youngest surface. Miranda, is the smallest             moonlet and it has a very rare surface with fault scarps.                Uranus","Neptune has 14 satellites. Triton, is the             largest of all of them. One side of Triton             is covered with ice so it earns the title             of one of the coldest satellites of the            Solar System with -240 degrees.  Also,             Triton is the largest satellite that has a             retrograde orbit, differs from others.            Differentiated from Jupiter and Saturn,             Neptune is classified as an ice giant just             like Uranus because of its structure.             Named after Neptunus, known as the             Roman god of the sea, Neptune is the             fourth largest planet by diameter and             the third most massive planet. Scientists            named Neptunes moons after lesser sea             Neptune            gods.","Pluto                         Pluto has five satellites. The largest one is called Charon.              The others are named Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx.             Charon, which is the largest of all, is only half the size of             Pluto.                  New planets,stars and moonlets are discovered             everyday.
