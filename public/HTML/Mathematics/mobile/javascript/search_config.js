Good luck!","What is an angle?               Angles in Maths are measured in degrees. It is the space between two rays or lines.              So, let’s move on from here. What is a ray?              What is a ray?                A ray is part of a line that can go on forever in one direction. It has a starting point but does             not have an endpoint.              So, let’s go on from here. What is a line?              What is a line?                A line is defined as a line of points that extends infinitely in two directions.              So, what else? What is a point?              What is a point?                A point in geometry is a location about something. It has no size, no width, no length             and no depth at all. A point is shown as a  dot. With this definition, we should ask more             questions such as; ‘What is Geometry?’, ‘What does no size mean?’, ‘What is width,             length or depth?’               We will answer these later on…             But first, let’s give information about ‘point’.               1.  A point has no size, no width, no length and no depth.             2.  A point is shown by the symbol (•).               3.  More than one line can pass through a point.                •  Pounding nails,                  •  Moles on our face,                 •  The pencil on a paper,                 •  The chalk on a black board leave point marks.                 •  Water drop,                 •  Points are named by capital letters.

They are all in different sizes. Now  let’s take points • this size            and put them next to each other. Look what happened!.

It is a line if it has a starting point and an end.            It is read as “Line AB”. Rulers are examples for lines.            For instance a point;                •  Can be some place in space                •  Stars               •  Two streets that connect each other                •  Cities on maps are examples for points.

More than one line can pass through a point.             As to lines...               A line is a mark connecting two points, something marking two things that relate to each            other.            •  It is known with its length.             •  It doesn’t have a starting point or an end.            •  A pencil sharpened from both sides, the skyline can be examples of a line.             •  Lines are named by both capital letters and lower case letters.

We use degrees to measure angles.            Angles are shown by the symbol “°”.             The corner of the angles are rays intersecting area. Rays are called the vertex.             Types of Angles:             1.  Acute angle ( If an angle is less than 90°)             2.  Right Angle ( If an angle is exactly 90°)             3.  Obtuse Angle (If an angle is more than  90° but less than 180°)             4. Straight Angle (If an angle is exactly  180°)             5.  Full Angle (A 360° angle)                            What is a Protractor?               A tool to use when measuring a specific angle.  If the angle to be measured is on the right            of the protractor, we use the inner readings of the protractor.

The vertical line is called the y-axis.            The horizontal line is called the x-axis.               How did it became a system?               •  The coordinate system follows history way back.              •  Transporting, trading, travelling or ground directions were easier with the system.              •  People use to find their location by focusing to a specific object or area, so that they                  don’t get lost.              •  The coordinate system first occurred in 270 B.C.              •  Scientists or philosophers such as Apollonius, Omar Khayyam, Descartes, Pascal,                  Newton and Leibniz used and improved the coordinate system although they lived in                  different times.                                  Apollonius Pergaeus  Omar Khayyam  René Descartes      Blaise Pascal      Isaac Newton   Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz                 MÖ 240 - MÖ 190     1048 - 1131     1596 - 1650        1623 - 1662        1642 - 1727        1646 - 1716               Where do we see The Coordinate System in real life?              It is thought that coordinate system is only used to find location but it is used in many              areas such as; economics, health, education, IT, engineering, husbandry, meteorology,              mechanics, computer design and space. Vikings set sail, Alexander the Great’s many              wars, Mongols massive kingdom, humankinds curiosity to discovery and many more              were carried through by coordinate system. If there wasn’t a coordinate system then              explorers like Cristof Columbus, Americo Vespucci, Bartolomeu Diaz or Magellan had              no chance to discover Leonardo Da Vinci, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali or Vincent Van              Gogh had no  chance to draw and most importantly the space adventure would never              begin.","Find the Coordinates             Find the location of the pictures.

What is Celsius (°C)?                 Fahrenheit, is a measure scale recommended by the German Physician Daniel Gabriel            Fahrenheit. According to Fahreheit, freezing point of water is 32 degrees, boiling point of            water is 212 degrees. It is shown as °F.              Celsius, is a measure scale recommended by the Swiss Astronomer Anders Celsius. It            is also known as Centigrade.
